## Content

This is my personal portfolio ðŸ’¼ website, it is made to showcases my work to potential clients or employers.

## Design

This website is designed to resemble a command line / text-based interface that allows you to enter commands in order to navigate through my portfolio.

The Minecraft ðŸ”¥ torch animation was purposfully added as a reference to give a primal look and feel, since the command line was the primitive way of interacting with an operating system.

## Inspiration

I firmly believe that using a terminal can be much more flexible, faster and customizable than using a graphical interface, particularly for a software engineer's job. You can often accomplish tasks with a single command or keystroke, whereas in a GUI, you may need to click through multiple menus or dialog boxes.

It is also an excuse to say that "I use arch btw".
